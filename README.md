### Usage

1. `go get -u github.com/nsnikhil/go-datastructures`

---

### Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/nsnikhil/go-datastructures>)
2. `make setup`
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

---

### Known Issues

1. Multiple implementation of sorting algorithm.
2. Concurrent search dose not provide enough performance benefits and also the benchmark test for the same sometimes gets into infinite loop.
